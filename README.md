# Color Bursts
Color Bursts is a generative composition that ran as a sound installation in the Phipps Botanical Gardens. The piece runs as a Pure Data patch, which handles the scheduling and looping of the various voices. The patch runs on a Raspberry Pi, which launches the patch on startup and runs it indefinitely.
